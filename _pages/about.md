I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [**Department of Economics at the University of Essex**](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/economics).

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [ECARES at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](https://ecares.ulb.ac.be) and held a Research Associate position in the [Department of Economics at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven)](https://feb.kuleuven.be/eng). In addition, I was a member of the [Group for the Advancement of Revealed Preferences (GARP)](https://revealedpreferences.org/). 

I have received my Ph.D. from the [Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science](https://ices.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/).

**Research interests**: experimental economics, behavioral economics, game theory, and revealed preference theory.

Here is my [CV](http://mlfreer.github.io/files/paper1.pdf).
