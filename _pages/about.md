I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Economics at the University of Essex.

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the ECARES at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and held a Research Associate position in the Department of Economics at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven). In addition, I was a member of the Group for the Advancement of Revealed Preferences (GARP). 

I have received my Ph.D. from the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University.

**Research interests**: experimental economics, behavioral economics, game theory, and revealed preference theory.
